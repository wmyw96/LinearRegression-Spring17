### Homework 1: The Evalution of Parameter Estimator for Simple Linear Model

**Abstract**

In this paper, we get in the model of simple linear regression and proposed five main estimators of it. Then we carefully analyse the estimatorsâ€™ intuitive behaviour and calcuate their analytical or numerical solution. We then design the experiments, especially in data generation. We expose the estimator to different kind of pseudo-data designed above and generated by R and anaylse its performance in four main perspectives: minumum variance, bias, consistence and large sample property. Finally we visualize the fitted line of these estimators and demonstrate the intuitive understanding of the five estimators.
